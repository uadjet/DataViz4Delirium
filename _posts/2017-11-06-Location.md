Delirium is a serious disturbance in mental abilities that results in confused thinking and reduced awareness of your environment.  The UCSF DRI aims to reduce rates of delirium in patients by diagnosing patients early and treating symptoms more effectively.

This dashboard presents a location by location view of the performance of the DRI since it began in Fall 2016. The graphs assess the delirium metrics for each location as well as their compliancy rates.

# Delirium Metrics
This graph shows the average delirium duration (the number of days a patient spent delirious) by location  and the average length of stay by location for 2017.
{% include unit/Del_Metrics.html %}
All locations except for 10LS CVT (red) showed a decrease in delirium duration. The lowest and highest average of each metric is annotated for convenience.

# Patient Delirium over time
This graph displays the percent of patients who were delirious and the average percent of time the patient spent delirious by location from the start of the initiative in 2016 to the most recent data points in 2017.
{% include unit/Del_Patients_Time.html %}
The beginning and the end percents are calculated and displayed for quicker analysis. The trends for both metrics vary among locations, with some locations doing better, some doing worse, and some staying approximately the same.
