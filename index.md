Delirium is a serious disturbance in mental abilities that results in confused thinking and reduced awareness of your environment.  The UCSF Delirium Reduction Initiative (DRI) aims to reduce rates of delirium in patients by diagnosing patients early and treating symptoms more effectively.

This dashboard presents an overview of the performance of the DRI since it began in Fall 2016.  The graphs assess the program’s impact on patient care and well-being, demonstrating that delirium duration and length of stay has decreased, while compliance rate has increased.

These graphs shows the average delirium duration (the number of days a patient spent delirious) over all patients and the average length of stay over all patients from the start of the program in 2016 to the current data in 2017.

The  most drastic changes are the 24.71% decrease in patients who went against medical advice between 2016 and 2017 and the 6.66% increase in patients who were released to a secondary care facility between 2016 and 2017.

The rates of compliance for AWOL and NuDESC are calculated since the start of the program as well as in just 2017.
